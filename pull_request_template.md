In this Pull Request,
- I have created a mobile menu that:
  - When the user clicks (or taps) the button to check project details, the popup with details about the project appears.
  - When the user clicks (or taps) the close (X) button, the popup disappears.

- Made sure that I documented my work in a professional way.
- Made sure that I used correct GitHub flow.
- Made sure that there are no linter errors.
